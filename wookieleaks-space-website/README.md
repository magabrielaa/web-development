# Wookieleaks - The place for all things space

This is a fun personal project website about space, with references for Star Wars fans like me. 
The simple "mission control" dashboard contains a few interesting facts about space:

* NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), retrieved daily from [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov)
* Information about the closest asteroid to approach Earth: NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) from [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov) RESTful web service
* Number of people in space right now, represented by a Baby Yoda animation, retrieved from [Open Notify's API](http://open-notify.org)
* Details on SpaceX's Latest Launch, retrieved from [SpaceX's API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)
* GPS location on a map of where in the world the International Space Station is currently over, represented by a Darth Vader avatar, data retrieved from [Open Notify's API](http://open-notify.org)

Enjoy!
